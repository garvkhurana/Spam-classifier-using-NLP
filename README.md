Spam Classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes
Introduction
Welcome to the Spam Classifier repository! In this project, I have built a spam classifier using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The classifier is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam (ham) messages. The goal is to accurately classify incoming messages as spam or ham.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the spam classifier consists of messages labeled as spam or ham. It is a commonly used dataset for text classification tasks. The dataset can be found at [insert link to dataset].

Preprocessing
Before training the classifier, the text data undergoes preprocessing steps to enhance its quality and usability. The preprocessing steps include:

Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
Lemmatization: Converting words into their base or dictionary form.
Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical vectors using techniques such as CountVectorizer.
Model Training
The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is used for training the spam classifier. It is a popular algorithm for text classification tasks and works well with datasets containing discrete features, such as word counts.

Usage
To use the spam classifier:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the train_classifier.py script to train the classifier on the dataset.
After training, you can use the trained classifier to predict whether a message is spam or ham by calling the appropriate functions in the predict.py script.
Future Improvements
While the current version of the spam classifier achieves decent performance, there are several areas for future improvement:

Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to improve classification accuracy.
Explore additional text preprocessing techniques to further enhance model performance.
Consider incorporating feature engineering or feature selection methods to improve model interpretability and generalization.
